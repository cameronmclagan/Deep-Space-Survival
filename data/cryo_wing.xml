		This small room is well-lit and smells of sanitized air. A huge machine
		dominates one half of the room; the cryonic recovery module responsible
		for restoring frozen bodies to life. The rest of the room is decorated
		with various medical devices related to the thawing process. There are
		two ways out; a door marked 'Supplies' and another marked 'Recovery
		Suite'.

		This is a standard air-tight automatic door controlled by motion
		sensors. Most star ships and space stations use a variation on this
		design due to its combination safety and convenience. Such doors are
		almost always controlled by a central network of some kind so that they
		can be remotely opened or closed. The door seems to be locked in the
		open position; the status lights above it indicate that this is because
		a general evacuation order is in place."

		This huge machine is responsible for restoring life to cryonically
		frozen bodies. The largest part of the device is a tube-shaped thawing
		chamber which holds the body during the revival process. Numerous thick
		tubes connect the chamber to a series of liquid storage tanks. One end
		of the machine is attached to the wall; it looks like the frozen bodies
		are fed through automatically from another room. The whole arrangement
		is flanked by control computers and diagnostic equipment.
