		This is a standard air-tight automatic door controlled by motion
		sensors. Most star ships and space stations use a variation on this
		design due to its combination safety and convenience. Such doors are
		almost always controlled by a central network of some kind so that they
		can be remotely opened or closed. The door seems to be locked in the
		open position; the status lights above it indicate that this is because
		a general evacuation order is in place."

		This huge machine is responsible for restoring life to cryonically
		frozen bodies. The largest part of the device is a tube-shaped thawing
		chamber which holds the body during the revival process. Numerous thick
		tubes connect the chamber to a series of liquid storage tanks. One end
		of the machine is attached to the wall; it looks like the frozen bodies
		are fed through automatically from another room. The whole arrangement
		is flanked by control computers and diagnostic equipment.
